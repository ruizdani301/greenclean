Now that we know 2 important sections of the application, we will request the consolidation in kilograms of all the waste collected in 2007, for this we will select all the materials, the date initial and the date end for a more precise calculation and at the end, we must click on Run Query, this will result in a graph with the most relevant percentages, as well as a list that details the information with the amount of waste in kilograms.

Just as we were able to consult, we can also save the query data, the user who made the query and the comment that details the query made.
